    NAME
       less - opposite of more

    DESCRIPTION
       Less  is  a  program similar to more(1), but it has many more features.  Less does not have to read the entire
       input file before starting, so with large input files it starts up faster than text editors like vi(1).   Less
       uses  termcap  (or  terminfo on some systems), so it can run on a variety of terminals.  There is even limited
       support for hardcopy terminals.  (On a hardcopy terminal, lines which should be printed  at  the  top  of  the
       screen are prefixed with a caret.)

       Commands  are  based  on  both more and vi.  Commands may be preceded by a decimal number, called N in the de‚Äê
       scriptions below.  The number is used by some commands, as indicated.
